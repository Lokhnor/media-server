1
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,260
<i>Triple-zero,
what is your emergency?</i>

2
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,460
<i>9-9-9,
what's your emergency?</i>

3
00:00:22,595 --> 00:00:24,093
<i>9-1-1,
what is your emergency?</i>

4
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:26,429
<i>No one knows
what's true anymore.</i>

5
00:00:27,065 --> 00:00:28,662
<i>It's not the end
of the world, but you can see--</i>

6
00:00:28,798 --> 00:00:30,069
<i>Power grid has collapsed.</i>

7
00:00:30,204 --> 00:00:31,532
<i>Currency is worthless.</i>

8
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:32,734
<i>Cities are burning.</i>

9
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:34,072
<i>Pestilence and pandemics.</i>

10
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:35,441
<i>Catastrophic heat.</i>

11
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,870
<i>We're actually
running out of water.</i>

12
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,744
<i>Why are you
hurting these people?</i>

13
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:42,009
<i>Getting close to
the terminal freak-out point.</i>

14
00:00:42,145 --> 00:00:45,384
<i>Mankind has gone rogue,
terrorizing itself.</i>

15
00:00:53,123 --> 00:00:56,227
<i>Gangs are marauding
like locusts across the land.</i>

16
00:00:56,362 --> 00:00:57,823
<i>The earth is sour.</i>

17
00:00:57,959 --> 00:00:59,299
<i>Our bones are poisoned.</i>

18
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,861
<i>We have become half-life.</i>

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,476
<i>As the world falls around us,</i>

20
00:01:15,611 --> 00:01:18,450
<i>how must we brave its cruelties?</i>

21
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:52,785
This one's for me.

22
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:57,853
I'll get that one for you.

23
00:01:58,422 --> 00:02:00,321
We should go back now.

24
00:02:00,457 --> 00:02:01,658
We've come too far.

25
00:02:04,161 --> 00:02:05,464
Furiosa!

26
00:02:09,235 --> 00:02:10,201
Hey, Vulture.

27
00:02:10,336 --> 00:02:12,373
Shh! Not so loud.

28
00:02:13,243 --> 00:02:15,371
Have you ever seen
so much meat?

29
00:02:15,507 --> 00:02:16,805
Stay very still.

30
00:02:17,947 --> 00:02:20,638
Meat.

31
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:29,389
Valkyrie, be invisible.
Still as a rock till I get back.

32
00:02:34,963 --> 00:02:36,121
Be invisible.

33
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:07,058
Careful.
Careful with the head.

34
00:03:07,194 --> 00:03:08,494
That spine's mine.

35
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:11,233
Cut right there.

36
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:31,412
Hear that?

37
00:04:25,105 --> 00:04:26,033
Get on! Get on!

38
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,348
Furiosa! They took Furiosa!

39
00:05:23,792 --> 00:05:24,932
I'll come with you.

40
00:05:25,068 --> 00:05:26,566
No, they need you here.

41
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,341
The stars be with you.

42
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:36,130
Snipers!
We got snipers.

43
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,401
Lone rider.

44
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:32,686
She fouled us.

45
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:39,387
She bit through it.

46
00:08:39,856 --> 00:08:41,890
Hey! What are you doing?

47
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:43,422
Hey, give it. Give it. Give it!

48
00:08:53,606 --> 00:08:55,236
That's the Thunderbike.

49
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,040
That's the Thunderbike!

50
00:09:06,887 --> 00:09:08,755
- I thought you crippled it.
- I did!

51
00:09:11,327 --> 00:09:12,517
Who's coming for us?

52
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,458
Who is-- who is that?
Is that your pa?

53
00:09:18,394 --> 00:09:19,925
- Is that your father? Who--

54
00:09:20,061 --> 00:09:22,230
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey!

55
00:09:27,611 --> 00:09:28,971
Ditch the girl!
That's all he wants.

56
00:09:29,106 --> 00:09:30,810
- What do we tell Dementus?

57
00:09:31,742 --> 00:09:32,740
We got horse meat.

58
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,176
It proves nothing.

59
00:09:34,311 --> 00:09:37,845
But the girl, once he sees her,
he's gonna ask,

60
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:39,115
"Where did she come from?"

61
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,646
And we're gonna be the ones
to tell him.

62
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:43,281
No one's gonna
scum us anymore.

63
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,924
No one's gonna
scum us anymore.

64
00:09:45,894 --> 00:09:47,688
No one's gonna
scum us anymore!

65
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:51,160
That piece of filth!

66
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:22,185
- Whoo-hoo!
- We're gonna make it.

67
00:11:23,155 --> 00:11:25,386
- We're gonna make it!

68
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,641
I got news for Dementus.
Dementus!

69
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,612
What do you got here, Toe Jam?
All by yourself.

70
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,285
I speak only to Dementus.

71
00:11:58,955 --> 00:12:00,051
No. Hands off.

72
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:01,158
Untie it.

73
00:12:02,226 --> 00:12:04,062
I found it. She's mine.

74
00:12:06,302 --> 00:12:07,296
Hands off.

75
00:12:09,067 --> 00:12:11,136
It's strong. What a dilly, eh?

76
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:12,230
She's mine.
Where did you find it?

77
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:13,366
- Give it back.
- Where?

78
00:12:13,502 --> 00:12:15,368
- Where did you get it?
- Give her back.

79
00:12:15,504 --> 00:12:17,478
Give her to me.
I'll take her to him.

80
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:19,913
She's from a place of abundance.

81
00:12:21,716 --> 00:12:22,883
What are you talking about?

82
00:12:23,018 --> 00:12:26,813
A place of abundance!
It's got everything!

83
00:12:26,948 --> 00:12:28,213
Where?

84
00:12:28,349 --> 00:12:30,755
I speak only to Dementus.

85
00:12:30,891 --> 00:12:31,793
Where are you from?

86
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,458
Where are you from?

87
00:12:40,228 --> 00:12:41,132
Where did you find her?

88
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:44,668
My lips, Dementus's ear.

89
00:12:44,803 --> 00:12:47,369
My lips. Dementus.

90
00:13:19,408 --> 00:13:20,472
Good girl.

91
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,114
The original
JRL Cycles Lucky Seven

92
00:13:28,249 --> 00:13:31,852
was powered by a seven cylinder
radial aircraft engine,

93
00:13:31,987 --> 00:13:36,790
with a swept capacity
of 2,800cc's,

94
00:13:36,926 --> 00:13:40,690
110 horsepower,
160 pounds of torque.

95
00:13:40,825 --> 00:13:41,819
Dementus.

96
00:13:44,462 --> 00:13:47,330
- Dementus. Look what I found.

97
00:13:53,906 --> 00:13:54,942
Who do we have here?

98
00:14:01,077 --> 00:14:02,578
What's your name?

99
00:14:03,014 --> 00:14:04,409
What do they call you?

100
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:06,547
She's from a place of abundance.

101
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:09,253
- May I?
Mm-hmm.

102
00:14:28,406 --> 00:14:30,938
A healthy,
well-nourished full-life.

103
00:14:31,073 --> 00:14:32,276
Flawless.

104
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,515
Tell us where
you're from, child. Eh?

105
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,418
Tell your friend.

106
00:14:44,055 --> 00:14:45,289
It's got everything.

107
00:14:47,729 --> 00:14:48,820
How do you know that?

108
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:55,398
A Roobilly told me.

109
00:14:56,698 --> 00:14:58,467
He said he saw it
with his own eyes.

110
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:00,572
Hm.

111
00:15:00,707 --> 00:15:01,767
And where is he?

112
00:15:04,372 --> 00:15:05,837
Let's hear from Toe Jam.

113
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,510
Bring him in.

114
00:15:12,882 --> 00:15:16,981
This place, where you found her,
it was amazing, right?

115
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:21,494
It had everything, right?
Water, food, everything.

116
00:15:23,894 --> 00:15:24,999
Tell me.

117
00:15:32,367 --> 00:15:33,140
He's choking.

118
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:35,466
Well, hang him upside down.

119
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:40,113
Downside up.

120
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,076
There you go.

121
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:45,747
Draw a map.

122
00:15:46,317 --> 00:15:48,682
Draw an arrow. Draw an arrow!

123
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,359
Show us! Show us!

124
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:11,907
Now, you have had
a hard day, haven't you?

125
00:16:12,043 --> 00:16:13,212
An awful day.

126
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:16,413
You must be exhausted.

127
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:20,950
There's only one thing I need
you to do and that is rest.

128
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,683
You don't have to
tell us anything.

129
00:16:22,818 --> 00:16:24,788
You don't have to say a word,
I promise.

130
00:16:24,923 --> 00:16:26,192
Just rest.

131
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,520
Tomorrow, I'll take you home.

132
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,521
I'll follow the tracks
that brought you here

133
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,166
and I'll take you home.

134
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,797
Take her, feed her, wash her.

135
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:40,041
Use our best drinking water.

136
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:45,242
You two.

137
00:16:45,377 --> 00:16:46,740
Keep an eye on her,
keep her safe.

138
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,643
Don't let any
of these brutes near her.

139
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:52,245
Hey, what you got there?

140
00:18:22,173 --> 00:18:24,601
Snapper. Snapper!

141
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:31,482
Ma!

142
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:36,454
Please. I'm a mother, too.

143
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,822
I will say nothing, not a word.

144
00:19:13,896 --> 00:19:16,153
Stop! Stop her!

145
00:19:18,331 --> 00:19:21,664
- Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
- Shoot!

146
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:34,842
It's not my fault.

147
00:19:36,314 --> 00:19:37,548
We've lost her!

148
00:19:56,137 --> 00:19:57,062
Good, we're good.

149
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,567
You're bleeding.

150
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,965
Do you hear that? Come, quick.

151
00:20:39,106 --> 00:20:40,611
How are they tracking us?

152
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:14,347
Ride to high ground.
Hide yourself well.

153
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,011
If I don't find you in one day,
go home.

154
00:21:16,147 --> 00:21:17,350
Ma, I--

155
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:18,683
Take your bearings
from the sun and stars.

156
00:21:18,818 --> 00:21:20,149
When there is wind,
use it to cover your tracks.

157
00:21:20,851 --> 00:21:22,179
- I'm not gonna leave you.
- Furiosa!

158
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:24,715
You are Vuvalini,
you'll do as I ask.

159
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:30,288
Whatever you have to do,
however long it takes,

160
00:21:31,224 --> 00:21:33,466
promise me
you'll find your way home.

161
00:21:34,936 --> 00:21:36,502
Plant this seed.

162
00:21:37,435 --> 00:21:38,999
Protect the Green Place.

163
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:42,970
Give me this one gift. Promise.

164
00:22:07,898 --> 00:22:09,260
The stars be with you.

165
00:22:38,127 --> 00:22:39,697
Go around!
Gotta go around!

166
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,832
Find a way around!

167
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:30,074
Ma!

168
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:31,610
Ma!

169
00:23:33,586 --> 00:23:34,913
- Ahh...
Tell me!

170
00:23:35,048 --> 00:23:36,385
She's your mother. Perfect.

171
00:23:36,521 --> 00:23:39,460
Where are you from?

172
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:41,224
Tell me!

173
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,496
Ma!

174
00:23:44,229 --> 00:23:46,494
Tell me where you came from
and we will cease and desist.

175
00:23:46,629 --> 00:23:49,160
Furiosa!

176
00:23:49,296 --> 00:23:50,601
- All you have to do...

177
00:23:50,737 --> 00:23:53,563
All you have to do
is just point.

178
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:57,071
Point me in the right direction
and I'll take you home.

179
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:00,305
No, no, no. Don't look away.

180
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:02,514
We mustn't look away.

181
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,584
You had your chance.

182
00:24:06,918 --> 00:24:09,622
History Man,
a Word Burger, please?

183
00:24:10,189 --> 00:24:11,157
Tears.

184
00:24:11,293 --> 00:24:13,023
Human tears.

185
00:24:13,158 --> 00:24:15,560
The secretions of the lacrimal
gland containing oils,

186
00:24:15,696 --> 00:24:17,959
salts, proteins,
and stress hormones.

187
00:24:18,094 --> 00:24:19,532
The tears of joy
and those of sorrow

188
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,293
have different
chemical compositions.

189
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,901
Yes. Sorrow is more...

190
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:27,904
...piquant, zesty.

191
00:25:15,888 --> 00:25:17,184
Why would you
run from me?

192
00:25:19,522 --> 00:25:22,255
Now your followers must fight
over who gets to kill you.

193
00:25:23,325 --> 00:25:24,856
Now, I would've welcomed you.
Every one.

194
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,259
I woulda brought you in.

195
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:28,635
You coulda been a part
of this great horde.

196
00:25:29,601 --> 00:25:32,104
Now, we have a problem.

197
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,269
There are 20 of you,
but only five bikes.

198
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,304
How do we choose?

199
00:25:38,439 --> 00:25:41,038
Who's got the goods,
the bollocks, the testes

200
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:42,847
to ride with Dementus?

201
00:25:44,214 --> 00:25:46,180
You're gonna have to show me
who you are.

202
00:25:49,717 --> 00:25:50,787
Yes?

203
00:25:50,923 --> 00:25:55,022
Because today
we dance to Darwin.

204
00:25:55,158 --> 00:25:59,264
Today, we do
The Five Bike Teddy.

205
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:03,065
Ready, setty, go!

206
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,356
You don't have to watch
if you don't want to.

207
00:26:31,731 --> 00:26:33,326
You may wanna close your eyes.

208
00:26:39,434 --> 00:26:41,972
You know,
you could hold this if you want.

209
00:26:44,238 --> 00:26:46,672
It belonged to my little ones.

210
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:49,507
Why don't you
just keep him safe?

211
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:04,858
Lady and gentlemans,
start your engines.

212
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:32,187
Lizard mince
and human blood sausage.

213
00:28:15,337 --> 00:28:16,803
Can you write?

214
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,234
I can teach you.
Muscle up your memory.

215
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:23,876
You could become a History Man.

216
00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:32,918
Make yourself invaluable,

217
00:28:34,086 --> 00:28:36,119
and Dementus
will look after you.

218
00:29:21,296 --> 00:29:23,095
<i>Astronavigation.</i>

219
00:29:23,965 --> 00:29:28,300
<i>A determination of one's course
by reference to the stars</i>

220
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:31,042
<i>and other celestial bodies.</i>

221
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:41,580
Red! Red!

222
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:44,057
Are we curious, boss?

223
00:29:44,626 --> 00:29:46,453
Well, let's go have a look.

224
00:30:07,077 --> 00:30:08,508
Is this Halvalla?

225
00:30:09,077 --> 00:30:10,444
Am I in Valhalla?

226
00:30:11,078 --> 00:30:12,213
What's Valhalla?

227
00:30:12,348 --> 00:30:14,444
Valhalla's
"The Hall of the Slain."

228
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,454
A paradise for dead heroes.

229
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,649
Good for you.

230
00:30:17,784 --> 00:30:19,222
We're looking for a place
of abundance.

231
00:30:19,923 --> 00:30:21,151
What's abundance?

232
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,864
Abundance, plentifulness.

233
00:30:25,066 --> 00:30:28,867
Having a copious quantity
of something.

234
00:30:29,003 --> 00:30:31,232
Co--
What's "copus quantity"?

235
00:30:31,367 --> 00:30:33,099
A lotta stuff.
A lotta good stuff.

236
00:30:33,234 --> 00:30:34,197
The Citadel.

237
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,341
The what-a-del?

238
00:30:35,977 --> 00:30:37,003
It's where I was birthed.

239
00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:38,404
It's got everything.

240
00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:40,739
A humongous amount
of fresh water.

241
00:30:41,141 --> 00:30:42,280
And green stuff.

242
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:47,419
Mountains of pro-juice
and veggies and... and water.

243
00:30:48,155 --> 00:30:50,088
And where would one
find this Citadel?

244
00:30:51,888 --> 00:30:53,491
That way maybe.

245
00:30:53,626 --> 00:30:54,356
What are these?

246
00:30:55,459 --> 00:30:57,854
That is sky blood.
It called you to me.

247
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,471
Behold the might of Dementus!

248
00:32:50,842 --> 00:32:53,339
The Red Dementus

249
00:32:53,474 --> 00:32:57,809
and his Congress of Destruction.

250
00:32:58,986 --> 00:33:02,150
He is here to lay siege on you.

251
00:33:02,286 --> 00:33:05,652
Listen carefully to his words.

252
00:33:10,293 --> 00:33:11,724
All of you.

253
00:33:13,126 --> 00:33:17,829
All who protect and honor
this magnificent Citadel,

254
00:33:19,102 --> 00:33:21,036
you have a choice.

255
00:33:21,172 --> 00:33:23,373
A very attractive choice.

256
00:33:25,307 --> 00:33:27,008
I want your leaders.

257
00:33:28,678 --> 00:33:32,285
I want those
who hold dominance over you.

258
00:33:33,221 --> 00:33:36,553
Bring me your leaders
and throw them down.

259
00:33:37,189 --> 00:33:38,724
Throw them down,
and you'll avoid

260
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,286
more suffering and sorrow.

261
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:44,427
They exploit you.
They enslave you.

262
00:33:44,562 --> 00:33:47,263
They wash their feet
in your sweat and blood

263
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:50,229
and they give you
nothing in return.

264
00:33:52,874 --> 00:33:55,197
Listen to this truth.

265
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:59,679
Big shots rule only
because you choose to follow.

266
00:33:59,814 --> 00:34:01,713
The power is with you.

267
00:34:01,849 --> 00:34:04,110
You are free to choose.

268
00:34:04,245 --> 00:34:06,085
Come to me.

269
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,755
Come to me
with your pain and burden,

270
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:10,883
and I will double your grub.

271
00:34:11,018 --> 00:34:14,089
Food and water for everyone,
as much you like.

272
00:34:14,225 --> 00:34:16,185
We will share the wealth.

273
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,699
You will rule with me in
the splendor of a new Wasteland.

274
00:34:35,111 --> 00:34:36,110
Adorable.

275
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,784
I'm afraid for you, sweetheart.
Really afraid.

276
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,619
'Cause Big Jilly here is gonna
scoop you out, both ends,

277
00:34:46,754 --> 00:34:48,855
mush it up
and feed it back to you.

278
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:51,589
But that ain't nothing compared
to what Mr. Norton here

279
00:34:51,724 --> 00:34:53,363
is dreaming of doing to you.

280
00:34:53,499 --> 00:34:56,169
'Cause Mr. Norton
really hates big shots.

281
00:34:56,304 --> 00:34:58,332
- Then there's Mr. Harley.
- G'day, mate!

282
00:34:58,467 --> 00:35:01,340
Mr. Davidson, Rizzdale Pell

283
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:05,002
and a thousand other
mad bastards coming after you,

284
00:35:05,137 --> 00:35:08,104
and there ain't nothing
I can do to stop 'em.

285
00:35:16,551 --> 00:35:19,016
The Immortan has a request.

286
00:35:20,228 --> 00:35:22,859
Among all his warriors
assembled here,

287
00:35:22,994 --> 00:35:24,494
choose one.

288
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,931
Why would I do that?

289
00:35:28,434 --> 00:35:30,429
For this negotiation
to go further,

290
00:35:30,565 --> 00:35:33,564
you must choose at random.

291
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:36,341
Any War Boy. Just one.

292
00:35:37,672 --> 00:35:40,072
What if I choose not to choose?

293
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:43,073
Then you'll never know
the truth.

294
00:35:46,052 --> 00:35:47,543
My Smeg will choose.

295
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:50,586
Yes!

296
00:35:54,354 --> 00:35:55,151
Okay.

297
00:36:09,637 --> 00:36:10,540
Nope. To the right.

298
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,806
You are awaited.

299
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:49,980
Witness me!

300
00:36:50,116 --> 00:36:52,208
Witness!

301
00:37:00,225 --> 00:37:01,789
Immorta!

302
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:07,763
Among us
are 972 devout warriors.

303
00:37:07,898 --> 00:37:12,195
Any one of them, if chosen,
would've done the same.

304
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:17,536
Each would die historic
for the Immortan Joe.

305
00:37:18,272 --> 00:37:20,739
- That's why you're fools.
You're the fool!

306
00:37:20,874 --> 00:37:23,775
You're all fools
for coming here.

307
00:37:30,617 --> 00:37:33,986
I am Scrotus.

308
00:37:35,863 --> 00:37:38,692
I am Rictus.

309
00:37:38,828 --> 00:37:42,368
We are the sons
of the Immortan Joe.

310
00:37:43,896 --> 00:37:47,098
And now we're going to kill you.

311
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:24,872
Hey!

312
00:38:53,237 --> 00:38:53,901
I gotcha.

313
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:25,405
<i>When things
go bonkers, you have to adapt.</i>

314
00:39:27,804 --> 00:39:30,040
- You, same as me.

315
00:39:30,176 --> 00:39:31,004
They're here.

316
00:39:32,474 --> 00:39:33,611
We're tough.

317
00:39:34,913 --> 00:39:37,041
- You're a tender little hound.

318
00:39:37,177 --> 00:39:39,149
A War Rig. Fully loaded.

319
00:39:39,819 --> 00:39:41,384
It's from
the Citadel, all right.

320
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,588
It's got the Immortan's mark.

321
00:39:52,025 --> 00:39:54,797
Food and water for guzzolene.

322
00:39:56,797 --> 00:39:58,636
It beats scavenging.

323
00:40:00,306 --> 00:40:02,431
This is our destiny.

324
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,071
We are indeed
in the land of opportunity.

325
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,545
Watch this.

326
00:41:31,794 --> 00:41:33,461
All hail Dementus!

327
00:41:33,596 --> 00:41:36,129
Dementus!

328
00:41:37,866 --> 00:41:40,799
Fuel for all, enough for months.

329
00:41:40,935 --> 00:41:43,335
Thisis truly a great day.

330
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:45,974
Yeah, well, I'm about to make it
a whole lot greater.

331
00:41:46,109 --> 00:41:48,581
Who are you?
Remove your helmet and jacket.

332
00:41:50,978 --> 00:41:52,875
I take orders from The Octoboss.

333
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:53,916
Huh?

334
00:41:57,819 --> 00:41:59,554
Yeah, do what he says.

335
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:03,057
Uh-uh...
Questioning my boss-ority.

336
00:42:09,665 --> 00:42:11,032
Okay.

337
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,399
All right, that's good.

338
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:18,842
Right. Go on.

339
00:42:19,841 --> 00:42:21,108
Cover yourself in this.

340
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,046
That's it.

341
00:42:26,649 --> 00:42:27,851
Come on. Come on.

342
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:31,415
Good?

343
00:42:32,819 --> 00:42:34,088
There ya go.

344
00:42:36,093 --> 00:42:38,554
Choose ten of your men.
The balder the better.

345
00:42:42,169 --> 00:42:43,267
Mortifiers.

346
00:42:43,403 --> 00:42:44,467
Settle down.

347
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,562
Who wants to be a War Boy?

348
00:43:28,742 --> 00:43:30,513
What?

349
00:43:30,648 --> 00:43:32,014
<i>The rig's coming back.
I think they're under attack.</i>

350
00:43:52,967 --> 00:43:54,740
Do we open the gates?

351
00:43:56,036 --> 00:43:57,501
No. Something's off.

352
00:44:01,482 --> 00:44:02,677
I'm gonna have to slow down.

353
00:44:02,812 --> 00:44:05,141
No. Faster. Go faster.

354
00:44:05,277 --> 00:44:06,483
They won't open the gate.

355
00:44:06,618 --> 00:44:07,984
They're not buying it.

356
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:15,160
Shoot them.

357
00:44:15,296 --> 00:44:16,326
What?

358
00:44:16,462 --> 00:44:17,488
Make it real.

359
00:44:19,664 --> 00:44:20,699
What'd he say?

360
00:44:20,835 --> 00:44:22,658
He wants us
to make it real.

361
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:28,336
What are you doing?

362
00:44:31,105 --> 00:44:33,242
No, no. No, no, no!

363
00:44:33,811 --> 00:44:37,211
You're scum, Dementus. Scum!

364
00:44:41,013 --> 00:44:42,018
Open the gates.

365
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:43,921
Open the gates!

366
00:45:34,737 --> 00:45:35,973
Open the gates.

367
00:46:03,997 --> 00:46:04,870
Back off.

368
00:46:05,669 --> 00:46:06,597
Get off.

369
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,810
Give this to Immortan Joe.

370
00:46:12,004 --> 00:46:12,944
Catch.

371
00:46:16,682 --> 00:46:18,345
Dementus wants to talk.

372
00:46:27,627 --> 00:46:29,189
Are you sure?

373
00:46:29,325 --> 00:46:31,292
Yes. Let him come.

374
00:46:32,423 --> 00:46:34,863
Body search, no weapons.

375
00:46:34,998 --> 00:46:37,601
Whatever he wants, we'll listen.

376
00:46:37,737 --> 00:46:40,202
Then kill him on the spot.

377
00:46:55,754 --> 00:46:56,713
Calm down.

378
00:46:57,787 --> 00:46:58,682
Calm down.

379
00:47:05,132 --> 00:47:07,560
The Red Dementus commends you
on your lifestyle

380
00:47:07,695 --> 00:47:11,497
and for agreeing to these
trade negotiations.

381
00:47:17,472 --> 00:47:19,774
If we're not back safe
by sunset,

382
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:21,111
we blow up Gastown.

383
00:47:24,983 --> 00:47:28,019
This is how you save Gastown.

384
00:47:41,501 --> 00:47:45,267
And the six-figure code exists
only in the brain of Dementus.

385
00:47:49,406 --> 00:47:51,934
He wants double.
Double of everything.

386
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:54,404
One full tank of water
for half a tank of guzzolene.

387
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:56,241
Can't do that. Not possible.

388
00:47:56,376 --> 00:47:58,049
Then he gets a spike in the nut.

389
00:47:59,682 --> 00:48:01,915
Double the mothers' milk
and double the hydroponics.

390
00:48:02,051 --> 00:48:03,780
Double the spuds.

391
00:48:03,915 --> 00:48:05,958
Double the maggot mash
and the roach gruel.

392
00:48:06,093 --> 00:48:08,149
My boys need all the protein
they can get.

393
00:48:09,588 --> 00:48:12,624
Please. Give him what he wants!

394
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:16,463
The Wasteland won't sustain it.
Run the numbers.

395
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,735
Please, my Immortan. My brother.

396
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:25,567
Make up your mind.

397
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:27,639
Can't hold this much longer.

398
00:48:29,243 --> 00:48:30,840
Let Rictus do it, Dad.

399
00:48:32,382 --> 00:48:33,444
I'll squeeze
the code out of him.

400
00:48:33,579 --> 00:48:35,087
- Here, take it. Take it.
- Huh?

401
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:42,753
Oh, you idiot.

402
00:48:44,556 --> 00:48:45,821
I've forgotten the numbers.

403
00:48:45,957 --> 00:48:47,256
Wait, wait, wait.

404
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:49,761
Wait!

405
00:48:49,897 --> 00:48:52,664
Yep, it's in there,
got it, got it, got it, okay.

406
00:48:54,868 --> 00:48:57,074
The pleasure flushed them
clean out of my head.

407
00:48:57,209 --> 00:48:58,304
Don't ever do that again, comrades.

408
00:48:58,439 --> 00:48:59,979
I'm a man with a fragile brain.

409
00:49:02,912 --> 00:49:03,807
Who's that?

410
00:49:07,515 --> 00:49:11,881
That... is my daughter,
Little D.

411
00:49:12,526 --> 00:49:13,817
Little Dementus.

412
00:49:16,357 --> 00:49:17,856
She looks nothing like you.

413
00:49:17,992 --> 00:49:19,522
Yes, well, she has
her mother's perfections,

414
00:49:19,657 --> 00:49:20,866
and none of my deficiencies.

415
00:49:21,001 --> 00:49:22,299
Where's the mother?

416
00:49:22,434 --> 00:49:25,402
Magnificent woman.
Fierce, intelligent.

417
00:49:25,538 --> 00:49:28,473
Taken so cruelly protecting
this little one from marauders.

418
00:49:28,608 --> 00:49:30,031
She looks pale.

419
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,475
You look pale. She's perfect.

420
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:35,645
Not like the genetic absurdities
you have for sons.

421
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:40,348
Well, she's pale
because I take her blood,

422
00:49:40,484 --> 00:49:42,817
for blood pudding
that I prepare for him.

423
00:49:42,952 --> 00:49:44,386
And who are you?

424
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:49,193
Well, I'm the Organic Mechanic.
All things therapeutic.

425
00:49:49,328 --> 00:49:52,797
Now, make no mistake,
she is a full-life.

426
00:49:52,932 --> 00:49:55,826
Untouched by man or disease.

427
00:49:59,173 --> 00:50:00,996
Would you like to stay here
in the Citadel?

428
00:50:01,508 --> 00:50:02,404
Eh?

429
00:50:03,541 --> 00:50:05,075
If I let you stay and you grow

430
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,571
to become a strong,
healthy woman,

431
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:08,510
you could become
one of our wives.

432
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:10,575
No, she's my daughter.

433
00:50:10,711 --> 00:50:12,882
It will be
a royal intermarriage.

434
00:50:13,018 --> 00:50:14,414
The bonding of dynasties.

435
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:16,517
Her whole life
I have protected her,

436
00:50:16,652 --> 00:50:18,279
from the sun, the wind,
every lecherous gaze.

437
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:19,190
No.

438
00:50:20,421 --> 00:50:22,125
You'll be bonded by blood.

439
00:50:22,261 --> 00:50:24,019
No! She's not for sale,
she's mine.

440
00:50:24,864 --> 00:50:26,725
What say you, child?

441
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:30,095
She hasn't spoken
since her mother's tragic end.

442
00:50:30,231 --> 00:50:31,532
Very poignant.

443
00:50:42,474 --> 00:50:44,248
Is he your father?

444
00:50:47,554 --> 00:50:48,384
No.

445
00:50:56,193 --> 00:50:57,921
He slaughtered my mother.

446
00:51:00,658 --> 00:51:02,090
True, that is true.

447
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:03,958
And I can tell you
it made this child tough.

448
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:05,561
Tough enough
to survive all sorrows

449
00:51:05,696 --> 00:51:06,704
that may come her way.

450
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,631
I did that for her.

451
00:51:08,766 --> 00:51:10,109
I did that for her.

452
00:51:14,808 --> 00:51:17,242
I will increase
your shipment of water.

453
00:51:17,378 --> 00:51:18,815
But only by a third.

454
00:51:19,418 --> 00:51:21,410
I will increase your food
by a quarter.

455
00:51:21,546 --> 00:51:23,287
Potatoes only.

456
00:51:23,422 --> 00:51:26,156
You'll get your delivery
once every ten days,

457
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:28,827
but only if my War Rigs
return safely

458
00:51:28,963 --> 00:51:31,460
full of high-grade guzzolene.

459
00:51:34,095 --> 00:51:34,826
Deal.

460
00:51:36,229 --> 00:51:41,437
And... I will take this girl,
who is not your daughter.

461
00:51:42,468 --> 00:51:44,638
And also, him.

462
00:51:46,539 --> 00:51:48,246
Otherwise, it's war.

463
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:33,555
You behave, I'll behave.

464
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:35,721
I'll protect Gastown
from all treachery.

465
00:52:35,857 --> 00:52:38,889
It will be as impenetrable
as this Citadel.

466
00:52:39,024 --> 00:52:41,963
Stability born
from a world of chaos.

467
00:52:42,098 --> 00:52:44,698
You. Me. We.

468
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:52,409
Henceforth, I will be addressed
as "The Great Dementus."

469
00:52:53,112 --> 00:52:55,247
Beloved ruler of Bikerdom.

470
00:52:56,181 --> 00:52:58,507
Lord Guardian of Gastown.

471
00:53:00,147 --> 00:53:02,584
Gotta go, gotta go.
Don't want Gastown to go boom.

472
00:53:03,686 --> 00:53:06,081
What a day.
What a deal. What a day.

473
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:07,923
Beautifully played, boss.

474
00:53:08,526 --> 00:53:10,823
- Peak Dementus! Eh? Eh?

475
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,796
It's all right.
You'll be all right.

476
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,036
<i>All right.</i>

477
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:58,268
Now, shove that little beauty
out into the world.

478
00:53:58,404 --> 00:53:59,975
Come on.

479
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:00,972
Here it comes.

480
00:54:01,872 --> 00:54:03,381
I can see its head.

481
00:54:06,849 --> 00:54:09,145
Good girl. Good girl.

482
00:54:11,118 --> 00:54:13,550
Oh, yeah.

483
00:54:13,686 --> 00:54:15,353
You're very clever.

484
00:54:15,488 --> 00:54:16,454
One last shove.

485
00:54:19,125 --> 00:54:20,661
One more, one more.

486
00:54:20,797 --> 00:54:23,665
- Very good.

487
00:54:26,832 --> 00:54:29,000
Is it a boy? Is it a boy?

488
00:54:32,572 --> 00:54:34,379
More or less.

489
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:37,272
Sorry, boss.

490
00:54:38,484 --> 00:54:40,148
I will give you a full-life!

491
00:54:40,283 --> 00:54:41,452
I know that I can.

492
00:54:42,455 --> 00:54:44,054
Three strikes, you're out.

493
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:45,687
- Rictus.

494
00:54:49,492 --> 00:54:50,994
Please, let me stay.

495
00:54:51,129 --> 00:54:52,789
Don't fret, love.

496
00:54:52,924 --> 00:54:55,334
You'll make an excellent milker.

497
00:56:28,788 --> 00:56:29,890
What's this?

498
00:57:17,739 --> 00:57:20,807
Rictus. You lose something?

499
00:57:20,943 --> 00:57:23,178
Just looking.
Just looking around.

500
00:57:23,313 --> 00:57:24,342
What for?

501
00:57:24,478 --> 00:57:26,177
Nothing.

502
00:57:26,312 --> 00:57:28,384
No. Don't lie to me.
You're up to something.

503
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,555
- What is it?
- Nothing.

504
00:57:31,921 --> 00:57:33,386
Well, what're you
doing here then?

505
00:57:34,793 --> 00:57:36,224
I thought
I saw someone running.

506
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,621
Running away.

507
00:57:38,357 --> 00:57:40,862
But it was just a dream.
An annoying dream.

508
00:58:30,082 --> 00:58:31,746
Brake!

509
00:58:31,881 --> 00:58:35,246
Dogman. The loose cable!
Secure it!

510
00:58:40,222 --> 00:58:44,057
Save the bucket!
We need that bucket!

511
00:58:56,736 --> 00:58:58,274
You go down.

512
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:00,403
No. Someone small.

513
00:59:01,476 --> 00:59:02,581
You!

514
00:59:04,248 --> 00:59:05,375
Come on.

515
00:59:08,483 --> 00:59:10,083
No. Him.

516
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:13,113
You've got a lot of ticker, boy.

517
01:00:13,912 --> 01:00:14,917
Brake Man.

518
01:00:23,396 --> 01:00:24,861
You're the new dogman.

519
01:00:50,787 --> 01:00:52,988
Line up. Line up.

520
01:00:54,459 --> 01:00:55,859
Juva-jub-jub.

521
01:00:58,325 --> 01:01:00,624
Welcome to the house
of holy motors.

522
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,697
We're gonna make us something
mighty from this boneyard,

523
01:01:03,833 --> 01:01:06,167
from all these body parts.

524
01:01:06,303 --> 01:01:08,998
Two hefty V8 engines,
a chassis for a Prime Mover,

525
01:01:09,134 --> 01:01:11,809
2,857 found objects.

526
01:01:11,944 --> 01:01:14,075
And we are going
to put this all together.

527
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:17,080
We are going to build
something beautiful.

528
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:19,879
And we're doing this for who?

529
01:01:20,014 --> 01:01:21,479
- Immortan Joe.
- Who?

530
01:01:21,614 --> 01:01:23,753
Who will raise us
from the ashes of this world.

531
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:25,814
Are you ready
to be Black Thumbs?

532
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:27,057
Immorta!

533
01:01:27,193 --> 01:01:27,882
You?

534
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:29,193
Immorta!

535
01:01:29,329 --> 01:01:30,487
How about you?

536
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:33,529
Speak his name.

537
01:01:33,665 --> 01:01:35,360
He don't speak. He's mute.

538
01:01:38,165 --> 01:01:39,404
Where have I seen you before?

539
01:01:39,539 --> 01:01:41,696
He's a dogman. Very useful.

540
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,370
Scrawny.

541
01:01:45,006 --> 01:01:46,967
Oi! We've got work to do.

542
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:50,243
We're going to build ourselves
a War Rig.

543
01:01:50,379 --> 01:01:53,142
The finest piece of grunt
in the Wasteland.

544
01:01:53,278 --> 01:01:55,745
Bigger, stronger, faster!

545
01:01:55,881 --> 01:01:57,422
Immorta!

546
01:01:57,557 --> 01:02:00,984
Immorta! Immorta! Immorta!

547
01:02:20,946 --> 01:02:22,369
We are going to build
a contraption

548
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:23,472
that will defend the rear.

549
01:02:23,608 --> 01:02:26,209
We will call it
"The Bommyknocker."

550
01:02:26,344 --> 01:02:28,050
Is that the Praetorian Jack?

551
01:02:32,424 --> 01:02:33,286
He looks lucky.

552
01:02:38,493 --> 01:02:40,161
He done the most runs
on the Fury Road.

553
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:43,300
And brung back the booty
every time.

554
01:02:43,435 --> 01:02:45,595
Hey. Prae Jack.

555
01:03:25,444 --> 01:03:27,010
What's going on?

556
01:03:36,788 --> 01:03:38,923
Why so shy? It's just piss.

557
01:03:44,997 --> 01:03:47,498
They were right,
the crazy brothers.

558
01:03:47,633 --> 01:03:49,096
She is a mighty thing.

559
01:03:49,231 --> 01:03:53,102
Bigger, faster,
stronger, further.

560
01:04:20,831 --> 01:04:21,823
Here it comes.

561
01:05:32,068 --> 01:05:33,569
They look like Mortifiers.

562
01:05:34,205 --> 01:05:36,102
Mortifiers.
They ride with Dementus.

563
01:05:36,237 --> 01:05:38,132
Not anymore. They've gone rogue.

564
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:39,333
Contact.

565
01:05:39,469 --> 01:05:41,168
Contact front!

566
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:42,469
You, go!

567
01:05:55,487 --> 01:05:57,957
Contact right. Contact left.

568
01:06:00,933 --> 01:06:02,324
Crossbows, War Boys.

569
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:03,292
Load up.

570
01:06:03,428 --> 01:06:04,134
Behind you!

571
01:06:06,538 --> 01:06:07,401
Go!

572
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:52,446
Witness!

573
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:15,403
That's engine two.

574
01:07:20,308 --> 01:07:22,674
All down on top. Replenish!

575
01:08:04,088 --> 01:08:06,019
We need a short hose and clamps!

576
01:08:06,155 --> 01:08:08,489
Short hose. Clamps.

577
01:08:09,895 --> 01:08:11,690
Short hose. Clamps.

578
01:09:26,265 --> 01:09:27,062
Yes!

579
01:09:39,777 --> 01:09:41,912
Black Thumb? Black Thumb.

580
01:09:51,863 --> 01:09:52,857
Up front.

581
01:09:53,692 --> 01:09:55,098
Can I do the Bommyknocker?

582
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:57,061
- What?
- The Bommyknocker.

583
01:09:57,197 --> 01:09:58,192
Not yet.

584
01:10:07,776 --> 01:10:09,472
Eyes left.
They're flanking us.

585
01:10:09,608 --> 01:10:11,408
Eyes right. Eyes right.

586
01:10:11,543 --> 01:10:12,448
They're swarming.

587
01:10:14,952 --> 01:10:16,386
Black Thumb.

588
01:10:25,729 --> 01:10:27,463
Black Thumb! Are you there?

589
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:33,194
Now hang tight.

590
01:10:57,887 --> 01:10:59,154
Prae Jack! Prae Jack!

591
01:11:20,344 --> 01:11:24,313
Pissboy. Pissboy!
We got a busted radiator.

592
01:11:25,082 --> 01:11:26,324
Copy P-Jack. On my way.

593
01:11:32,297 --> 01:11:33,826
Drink, my rig. Drink this piss.

594
01:11:34,461 --> 01:11:35,366
Come on.

595
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:48,346
Prae Jack.

596
01:12:14,301 --> 01:12:15,901
Witness!

597
01:12:58,446 --> 01:12:59,582
- No!

598
01:14:45,581 --> 01:14:47,387
The Bommyknocker!
Do the Bommyknocker!

599
01:14:47,523 --> 01:14:49,659
- Now?
- Now!

600
01:16:02,365 --> 01:16:03,458
Pull over.

601
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:07,099
You're going to pull over
and get out.

602
01:16:09,965 --> 01:16:10,971
Stop!

603
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:21,745
Where did
you think you were going?

604
01:17:28,854 --> 01:17:30,480
If you're running away
from the Citadel,

605
01:17:30,616 --> 01:17:33,486
believe me, the Bullet Farm
is a whole lot worse.

606
01:17:34,522 --> 01:17:37,651
The only other place is Gastown.
It's in the hands of Dementus.

607
01:17:37,786 --> 01:17:40,395
A mug who can't even
keep his gangs together.

608
01:17:40,964 --> 01:17:44,130
And that's it.
There is nowhere else.

609
01:17:44,832 --> 01:17:46,102
This is the Wasteland.

610
01:17:47,072 --> 01:17:49,564
Wherever you thought
you were going does not exist.

611
01:17:54,644 --> 01:17:55,944
It's been a hard day.

612
01:17:57,349 --> 01:17:58,606
I lost my convoy.

613
01:17:59,515 --> 01:18:00,784
I lost my crew.

614
01:18:02,016 --> 01:18:03,721
I'm gonna have to start again.

615
01:18:06,191 --> 01:18:08,858
And I'm driving off thinking
I ought to start with you.

616
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:13,994
You got good vision.

617
01:18:14,130 --> 01:18:15,826
You read the play
and you keep your head.

618
01:18:16,329 --> 01:18:17,862
You may be raw,
but you have about you

619
01:18:17,997 --> 01:18:19,660
a purposeful savagery.

620
01:18:21,164 --> 01:18:23,204
You give me time,

621
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:25,899
I'll teach you everything
you need to know about Road War.

622
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:29,910
If you survive everything
we take on together,

623
01:18:30,046 --> 01:18:31,074
you'll have
all the skills you need

624
01:18:31,210 --> 01:18:33,113
to get wherever you wanna go.

625
01:18:35,718 --> 01:18:37,216
No questions asked.

626
01:18:50,161 --> 01:18:52,099
Keep it. You'll need it.

627
01:19:25,429 --> 01:19:26,969
<i>The stars be with you.</i>

628
01:19:30,839 --> 01:19:32,601
<i>The stars be with you.</i>

629
01:19:40,785 --> 01:19:42,781
<i>You and me, Little D.</i>

630
01:20:08,141 --> 01:20:11,480
Immortan Joe!

631
01:20:47,513 --> 01:20:51,883
Two... four...
six... eight...

632
01:20:52,019 --> 01:20:53,550
Done. Tank's empty.

633
01:20:55,052 --> 01:20:56,692
Everything accounted, down to
the last drop of Mother's Milk.

634
01:20:56,828 --> 01:20:59,389
- Good.
- No, it's not good.

635
01:20:59,524 --> 01:21:01,094
That piece of anus-pus,
Dementus,

636
01:21:01,229 --> 01:21:02,931
is running Gastown
into the ground

637
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:04,660
and blaming everyone
but himself.

638
01:21:04,795 --> 01:21:07,436
You tell Immortan Joe
we need a meeting.

639
01:21:07,572 --> 01:21:09,172
A war meeting.

640
01:21:09,308 --> 01:21:12,636
Otherwise we're gonna get
our tits caught in the wringer.

641
01:21:13,539 --> 01:21:15,869
Here's the boomstick
you asked for.

642
01:21:24,914 --> 01:21:27,287
Thundersticks.
Bullets all loaded.

643
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:47,439
For you.

644
01:21:52,584 --> 01:21:54,017
For your travels.

645
01:21:55,378 --> 01:21:56,844
You're done here.

646
01:21:57,919 --> 01:21:59,286
You're free to go.

647
01:22:01,786 --> 01:22:05,996
Food, water, wheels,
whatever you need.

648
01:22:07,558 --> 01:22:09,461
I'll help you put it together.

649
01:22:11,594 --> 01:22:13,201
Give me a couple of days.

650
01:23:14,259 --> 01:23:15,692
We'll lead you in.

651
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:05,379
Move! Hurry up! Come on!

652
01:24:08,446 --> 01:24:10,252
Back! Get out then!

653
01:24:24,068 --> 01:24:25,933
<i>Stay back!</i>

654
01:24:26,068 --> 01:24:28,028
<i>Back! Stand back.</i>

655
01:24:30,667 --> 01:24:33,539
<i>Citizens of Gastown.</i>

656
01:24:33,674 --> 01:24:37,174
<i>I want what you want.
A full belly...</i>

657
01:24:37,744 --> 01:24:40,282
and a fistful of bullets
for a tank of gas.

658
01:24:42,217 --> 01:24:44,220
We have to put things right.

659
01:24:46,248 --> 01:24:49,258
And today, we're gonna
do something about it.

660
01:24:54,866 --> 01:24:56,298
Are you in charge here?

661
01:24:59,728 --> 01:25:01,094
You can speak to me.

662
01:25:01,629 --> 01:25:02,470
Yeah.

663
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,505
Well, I've got a message
for Immortan Joe.

664
01:25:07,111 --> 01:25:09,404
We're in a black spiral here.

665
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:11,810
We can't keep up supply.

666
01:25:11,946 --> 01:25:15,282
Everyone is saying they're being
swindled and short-changed.

667
01:25:15,418 --> 01:25:16,648
Everyone is saying
it's my fault.

668
01:25:17,284 --> 01:25:18,749
It's everyone's fault.

669
01:25:20,157 --> 01:25:22,153
I want a meeting
of the warlords.

670
01:25:22,889 --> 01:25:26,692
Me, him, the People Eater,
that idiot Bullet Farmer.

671
01:25:26,827 --> 01:25:29,562
High noon at the Citadel.
Three days from now.

672
01:25:32,494 --> 01:25:33,461
Right.

673
01:25:36,032 --> 01:25:37,064
- Ah, you better go.

674
01:25:38,608 --> 01:25:40,903
We're not leaving
without our tankers full of gas.

675
01:25:43,945 --> 01:25:45,176
Go now.

676
01:25:56,723 --> 01:25:58,657
You wanna get out of here,
follow me.

677
01:27:00,722 --> 01:27:03,623
High noon, the Citadel,
three days from now.

678
01:27:04,323 --> 01:27:05,526
Be punctual.

679
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:46,333
You give him
a full tank of water,

680
01:27:46,468 --> 01:27:48,864
and 2,000 tits of Mother's Milk

681
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,874
and then you return
empty-handed.

682
01:27:52,010 --> 01:27:53,803
Not a drop of guzzolene.

683
01:27:53,939 --> 01:27:55,472
He filched us.
We're being filched.

684
01:27:55,608 --> 01:27:57,305
Let's kill him. Right now.

685
01:27:57,441 --> 01:27:59,774
Shoulda done it long ago, Dad.
Shoulda crushed him, Dad!

686
01:27:59,909 --> 01:28:01,275
Father, give me the War Rig.

687
01:28:01,410 --> 01:28:03,453
Load it up with all
of the firepower you've got,

688
01:28:03,588 --> 01:28:05,786
and I will blow him
from the face of the earth.

689
01:28:05,922 --> 01:28:07,814
How do we do that
before he blows up Gastown?

690
01:28:07,949 --> 01:28:09,016
We'll build it again.

691
01:28:09,151 --> 01:28:10,893
That'd take generations,
you moron.

692
01:28:11,029 --> 01:28:12,560
We will build it again.

693
01:28:12,695 --> 01:28:15,154
Your way of thinking
is how he rooks us.

694
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:16,390
He's got you scared
of his crazy.

695
01:28:16,526 --> 01:28:17,497
Bah!

696
01:28:17,633 --> 01:28:19,060
Here's what we do!

697
01:28:19,195 --> 01:28:21,193
We conserve every drop
of guzzolene,

698
01:28:21,329 --> 01:28:23,170
turn off all vehicles,
all generators.

699
01:28:23,306 --> 01:28:24,537
Turn off every water pump

700
01:28:24,673 --> 01:28:26,367
including the Big Four
Aquifer Siphons.

701
01:28:26,503 --> 01:28:27,540
Get.

702
01:28:27,676 --> 01:28:29,505
At first light, leave
for Bullet Farm

703
01:28:29,641 --> 01:28:31,975
with your tankers empty.

704
01:28:32,110 --> 01:28:36,111
Then, return with every munition
you can load.

705
01:28:37,446 --> 01:28:41,181
I want every bullet and firearm,
every caliber and size.

706
01:28:41,317 --> 01:28:43,825
Your entire infantry
ready to pick up.

707
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:44,792
Good.

708
01:28:45,695 --> 01:28:47,663
Come to the watchtower.
We'll signal them now.

709
01:28:47,799 --> 01:28:50,830
Hell and Hall-elujah!
We're gonna take Gastown.

710
01:28:50,965 --> 01:28:52,898
Hit him! Hit him
when he least suspects it.

711
01:28:53,033 --> 01:28:55,801
How do we
stop him blowing up Gastown?

712
01:29:21,731 --> 01:29:25,699
This place at the end
of your map of secrets.

713
01:29:27,631 --> 01:29:28,570
Where is it?

714
01:29:42,285 --> 01:29:43,310
My mother and father...

715
01:29:44,748 --> 01:29:46,115
...were soldiers.

716
01:29:48,192 --> 01:29:49,625
Even as the world fell,

717
01:29:49,761 --> 01:29:52,627
they yearned to be warriors
for a virtuous cause.

718
01:29:55,123 --> 01:29:56,994
For them, it never happened.

719
01:30:00,734 --> 01:30:02,472
I wanna help you
find this place.

720
01:30:04,538 --> 01:30:06,135
Wherever it may be.

721
01:30:33,632 --> 01:30:34,636
Come with me.

722
01:31:13,770 --> 01:31:14,610
Ready?

723
01:31:28,087 --> 01:31:29,284
I want your bikes.

724
01:31:29,419 --> 01:31:30,851
Load them on the back
of the V8 Pursuit

725
01:31:30,986 --> 01:31:32,155
and tie them down.

726
01:31:34,193 --> 01:31:36,058
- Soon as that's done,

727
01:31:36,193 --> 01:31:38,200
load it with food,
fuel and water.

728
01:31:38,336 --> 01:31:39,934
As much as you can carry.

729
01:31:40,804 --> 01:31:42,572
What's this?
A scouting party?

730
01:31:43,473 --> 01:31:44,398
Possibly.

731
01:31:47,004 --> 01:31:48,338
What about us?

732
01:31:48,474 --> 01:31:50,177
You're both
gonna ride on the tanker.

733
01:31:50,313 --> 01:31:51,544
What about me?

734
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:53,682
You're promoted. Rear defense.

735
01:31:54,650 --> 01:31:55,717
- On the War Rig?
- Of course.

736
01:31:57,915 --> 01:31:59,050
What are you doing?

737
01:32:00,819 --> 01:32:02,355
Is there a problem?

738
01:32:02,490 --> 01:32:03,692
You drive the V8.

739
01:32:04,493 --> 01:32:05,626
I drive the War Rig.

740
01:32:05,761 --> 01:32:08,026
Not today.
Today you drive Pursuit.

741
01:32:09,224 --> 01:32:10,125
What am I gonna do?

742
01:32:10,260 --> 01:32:10,992
You're with me.

743
01:32:11,127 --> 01:32:12,625
- Up front?
- Up front.

744
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:14,633
As soon as we load up
the weapons and munitions,

745
01:32:14,768 --> 01:32:16,698
you can drive the rig back.

746
01:32:17,368 --> 01:32:19,575
All the way home?
To the Citadel?

747
01:32:19,710 --> 01:32:21,374
Yep.

748
01:32:21,510 --> 01:32:22,308
Go on.

749
01:32:22,444 --> 01:32:23,404
Whoo!

750
01:32:37,219 --> 01:32:38,793
Wanna see what this can do?

751
01:32:39,561 --> 01:32:40,960
Hit the second engine.

752
01:33:58,001 --> 01:33:58,840
All dead?

753
01:33:59,476 --> 01:34:00,303
Don't know.

754
01:34:02,043 --> 01:34:03,812
Sniper ambush!

755
01:34:05,848 --> 01:34:07,641
He's got backup. Outside.

756
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:09,312
Between the tanks.

757
01:34:13,215 --> 01:34:14,350
I can't see him.

758
01:34:26,899 --> 01:34:27,704
Behind you.

759
01:36:47,271 --> 01:36:48,537
Do not miss.

760
01:37:17,368 --> 01:37:18,732
- Whoo!

761
01:37:41,063 --> 01:37:42,525
Where are they?
Can you see them?

762
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:47,530
On the ridge,
to the left of the gate.

763
01:38:06,623 --> 01:38:07,649
Give me that.

764
01:38:18,066 --> 01:38:20,068
All right, load me up.
Come on.

765
01:38:21,263 --> 01:38:22,136
Come here.

766
01:39:44,983 --> 01:39:46,022
Jack!

767
01:40:34,067 --> 01:40:35,698
Yeah? We're good.

768
01:41:10,568 --> 01:41:12,640
We'll head east for three days.

769
01:41:13,577 --> 01:41:15,574
Once we clear the escarpment
and the great salt plains,

770
01:41:15,709 --> 01:41:17,938
we'll take the bikes
over the dunes all the way.

771
01:41:19,276 --> 01:41:20,578
All the way.

772
01:41:41,766 --> 01:41:43,735
The digger.
Let's use the digger.

773
01:41:43,871 --> 01:41:44,965
No time.

774
01:41:47,941 --> 01:41:48,672
Out.

775
01:44:16,883 --> 01:44:19,020
Fang it! Fang it!

776
01:45:24,861 --> 01:45:25,526
Hello?

777
01:45:26,929 --> 01:45:27,990
Heh?

778
01:45:59,329 --> 01:46:00,862
This one's still alive!

779
01:46:00,997 --> 01:46:01,760
Good.

780
01:46:08,798 --> 01:46:09,933
Get up here.

781
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:12,034
Come on, get up here.

782
01:46:14,506 --> 01:46:16,773
Did you see that?

783
01:46:16,909 --> 01:46:18,243
You see how they fought
for each other,

784
01:46:18,379 --> 01:46:20,273
this little army of two?

785
01:46:21,716 --> 01:46:24,211
Where were they going,
so full of hope?

786
01:46:25,451 --> 01:46:27,448
There is no hope!

787
01:46:28,417 --> 01:46:31,058
Not for them, not for you!
Certainly not for me!

788
01:46:33,258 --> 01:46:36,465
The day I acquire Bullet Farm,
these two destroy it.

789
01:46:37,897 --> 01:46:39,831
I had Gastown,
I had Bullet Farm.

790
01:46:39,966 --> 01:46:41,434
With that,
I coulda crippled the Citadel.

791
01:46:41,569 --> 01:46:43,472
- Jack.
- Ruled the Wasteland!

792
01:46:43,607 --> 01:46:45,098
- The Wasteland woulda been...
- My Jack.

793
01:46:45,234 --> 01:46:45,930
...a far better place
for all of us.

794
01:46:46,066 --> 01:46:46,898
Fury.

795
01:46:47,033 --> 01:46:48,444
- Jack.
- No!

796
01:46:51,113 --> 01:46:52,773
Get up.

797
01:46:52,909 --> 01:46:54,444
You two.

798
01:46:54,580 --> 01:46:57,018
You two break my heart.

799
01:46:57,154 --> 01:46:58,410
You break my heart.

800
01:46:59,651 --> 01:47:00,786
And that's not fair.

801
01:47:02,249 --> 01:47:05,626
You make me the Dark Dementus.

802
01:47:06,829 --> 01:47:09,963
The Dark Dementus
cannot afford to be soft!

803
01:47:10,766 --> 01:47:13,526
It's the price I pay
to be your leader!

804
01:47:13,662 --> 01:47:16,433
It's the price we all pay
to survive in the Wasteland.

805
01:47:16,568 --> 01:47:18,837
We cannot be soft!

806
01:47:21,410 --> 01:47:23,138
There must be retribution.

807
01:47:25,248 --> 01:47:27,912
Justice and retribution.

808
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:44,797
Hey, hey, hey!

809
01:47:46,626 --> 01:47:49,462
I want her to watch a while.
String her up.

810
01:47:50,498 --> 01:47:54,206
You're going. You're going.
You're going.

811
01:47:54,341 --> 01:47:55,170
Let's go.

812
01:48:03,077 --> 01:48:04,553
No, mate, other arm.

813
01:48:07,148 --> 01:48:09,987
What? You lost your touch?

814
01:48:13,956 --> 01:48:14,959
I'll do it.

815
01:48:38,589 --> 01:48:41,722
Come on, piggy!
Get up. Get up!

816
01:48:57,834 --> 01:48:58,964
Let's go. Go.

817
01:50:01,236 --> 01:50:02,396
Smeg!

818
01:50:10,040 --> 01:50:11,845
Enough! Enough!

819
01:50:13,240 --> 01:50:14,441
I'm bored.

820
01:50:16,244 --> 01:50:18,247
Let's end our cares and go home!

821
01:52:38,089 --> 01:52:39,456
It's all right.

822
01:52:40,459 --> 01:52:43,425
Go back to sleep.
I'll make it nice for you.

823
01:52:45,895 --> 01:52:46,802
Stay!

824
01:52:48,098 --> 01:52:49,937
You'll find peace here.

825
01:52:58,978 --> 01:53:00,508
I'm the Praetorian Furiosa.

826
01:53:02,850 --> 01:53:04,952
I am the Praetorian Furiosa!

827
01:53:05,753 --> 01:53:06,954
What happened to you?

828
01:53:07,455 --> 01:53:08,516
Pull.

829
01:53:17,634 --> 01:53:19,190
Any sign of him?

830
01:53:19,325 --> 01:53:20,167
No.

831
01:53:21,136 --> 01:53:22,871
But there's something going on
at Gastown.

832
01:53:23,673 --> 01:53:25,230
I think he's blowing up Gastown.

833
01:53:25,366 --> 01:53:26,707
Rubbish.

834
01:53:26,842 --> 01:53:28,008
- Take a look.

835
01:53:29,576 --> 01:53:32,771
He fails to turn
up to a meeting and now this.

836
01:53:35,784 --> 01:53:37,041
It's fake.

837
01:53:37,644 --> 01:53:39,344
There's no possible advantage.

838
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:40,980
We shouldn't have waited.

839
01:53:41,849 --> 01:53:44,559
Why're we waiting now?
Let's go to Gastown now.

840
01:53:44,695 --> 01:53:45,960
He's not at Gastown.

841
01:53:48,998 --> 01:53:50,690
Where's Praetorian Jack?

842
01:53:51,997 --> 01:53:53,230
Where's our War Rig?

843
01:53:53,366 --> 01:53:54,500
He's taken the Bullet Farm.

844
01:53:54,636 --> 01:53:55,561
You're lying.

845
01:53:55,697 --> 01:53:56,702
He's taken
the Bullet Farm,

846
01:53:56,838 --> 01:53:58,330
and he's coming here next.

847
01:53:58,465 --> 01:53:59,898
How do you know that?

848
01:54:00,033 --> 01:54:02,203
They're coming with
grappling hooks and ladders.

849
01:54:02,339 --> 01:54:04,011
He wants to take the Citadel.

850
01:54:04,146 --> 01:54:05,470
Then we go to the Bullet Farm.

851
01:54:05,605 --> 01:54:07,179
Meet him head-on right now.

852
01:54:07,314 --> 01:54:09,683
It's Gastown that's burning.
He's at Gastown.

853
01:54:09,818 --> 01:54:11,986
He wants to draw you to Gastown.

854
01:54:12,121 --> 01:54:14,146
He wants you to leave
the Citadel exposed.

855
01:54:14,281 --> 01:54:15,654
So we stay here.

856
01:54:16,323 --> 01:54:19,258
We have three choices.
The coward's choice.

857
01:54:19,393 --> 01:54:22,089
Stay here and let Dementus
mess with our minds.

858
01:54:22,224 --> 01:54:23,391
The fool's choice,

859
01:54:23,526 --> 01:54:24,930
go out and meet
an invisible enemy

860
01:54:25,065 --> 01:54:26,925
on the road to the Bullet Farm.

861
01:54:27,060 --> 01:54:30,562
Or the warrior's choice,
go to Gastown and crush him.

862
01:54:30,697 --> 01:54:32,302
It is my choice.

863
01:54:32,438 --> 01:54:34,371
We make him think
we're going to Gastown.

864
01:54:37,571 --> 01:54:39,277
If you find him, he's mine.

865
01:55:04,606 --> 01:55:05,941
Yes. Yes!

866
01:55:08,804 --> 01:55:10,605
They're Gastown bound
for sure.

867
01:55:16,917 --> 01:55:18,142
So gullible.

868
01:55:18,945 --> 01:55:21,022
I hold them profoundly
in contempt.

869
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:35,068
Gentlemans, it's time.
Time to do war.

870
01:55:35,204 --> 01:55:37,669
Time to take back
what's rightfully ours.

871
01:55:37,804 --> 01:55:39,231
To the Citadel.

872
01:55:39,366 --> 01:55:41,266
Let's party!

873
01:56:36,232 --> 01:56:38,390
<i>There always was, is,</i>

874
01:56:38,526 --> 01:56:40,563
<i>and will be war.</i>

875
01:56:43,169 --> 01:56:45,073
<i>The Sumerian fought the Elamite.</i>

876
01:56:46,140 --> 01:56:48,208
<i>The Saxon fought the Viking.</i>

877
01:56:49,880 --> 01:56:51,805
<i>And so the histories grew.</i>

878
01:56:52,974 --> 01:56:54,945
<i>There were the Wars
of the Roses,</i>

879
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:56,249
<i>The Oranges.</i>

880
01:56:57,016 --> 01:56:58,713
<i>The Opium Wars.</i>

881
01:57:00,521 --> 01:57:04,686
<i>The One-Day, Six-Day,
Thousand-Day Wars.</i>

882
01:57:07,924 --> 01:57:11,759
<i>North against South.
East against West.</i>

883
01:57:15,833 --> 01:57:20,438
<i>The first, second,
third countless wars</i>

884
01:57:20,573 --> 01:57:22,638
<i>of religion
and righteous belief.</i>

885
01:57:26,873 --> 01:57:30,115
<i>The Oil Wars. Water Wars.</i>

886
01:57:30,250 --> 01:57:32,153
<i>The Tri-Nation Nuclear War.</i>

887
01:57:33,550 --> 01:57:35,882
<i>The Battle of the Boomtowns.</i>

888
01:57:37,322 --> 01:57:39,127
<i>And now, my dears...</i>

889
01:57:40,424 --> 01:57:42,922
<i>...The Forty-Day Wasteland War.</i>

890
01:58:01,509 --> 01:58:03,646
<i>Eyes for eyes.</i>

891
01:58:04,711 --> 01:58:06,715
<i>Teeth for teeth.</i>

892
01:58:09,519 --> 01:58:12,160
<i>Rage fueled by grief.</i>

893
01:58:36,447 --> 01:58:37,449
I need a vehicle.

894
01:58:38,948 --> 01:58:40,487
There's nothing here,
not even a bike.

895
01:58:40,623 --> 01:58:43,114
Winch me down.
- What're you gonna do? Walk?

896
01:58:47,358 --> 01:58:48,856
I've got a vehicle.

897
01:58:58,668 --> 01:59:00,538
Can't wait for you to see it.

898
01:59:07,378 --> 01:59:09,041
Isn't she wonderful?

899
02:00:22,685 --> 02:00:24,292
Hey! Look at this.

900
02:00:25,721 --> 02:00:27,262
I think this one might fit.

901
02:00:29,198 --> 02:00:31,057
Try it on! Try it on!

902
02:00:34,663 --> 02:00:36,293
Every moment wasted,

903
02:00:36,429 --> 02:00:39,098
that mongrel gets
farther and farther away.

904
02:00:39,701 --> 02:00:40,737
Coming up!

905
02:00:42,410 --> 02:00:43,939
And I want her fuel too.

906
02:00:44,075 --> 02:00:47,238
I want all of her fuel,
and her water and her weapon.

907
02:00:48,779 --> 02:00:51,616
A fool can run,
but he can't hide.

908
02:00:54,747 --> 02:00:55,422
It's gonna fit.

909
02:00:56,917 --> 02:00:58,287
Hey, Scrotus.

910
02:00:58,423 --> 02:01:00,127
- Scrotus!
- What?

911
02:01:00,262 --> 02:01:02,427
You'll need some proper tucker.

912
02:01:02,562 --> 02:01:04,296
- Canine kebab.

913
02:01:04,431 --> 02:01:05,624
We'll take it with us.

914
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:06,867
What do you mean, "us?"

915
02:01:07,003 --> 02:01:08,161
I'm coming with you.

916
02:01:08,296 --> 02:01:09,867
No, you're not.
You'll slow me down.

917
02:01:10,003 --> 02:01:12,038
I'm gonna make sure
that dumb Dementus is dead.

918
02:01:12,174 --> 02:01:12,997
No, you're not!

919
02:01:13,132 --> 02:01:14,533
You stay here and eat some dog.

920
02:01:26,847 --> 02:01:28,279
What was that?

921
02:01:28,415 --> 02:01:31,788
That is the darkest of angels.

922
02:01:32,757 --> 02:01:35,220
The fifth Rider
of the Apocalypse.

923
02:02:25,982 --> 02:02:26,804
Who are they?

924
02:02:27,540 --> 02:02:30,348
Someone competent
and excessively resentful.

925
02:02:30,484 --> 02:02:31,710
Who do you suppose they want?

926
02:02:31,846 --> 02:02:33,344
Me, without my crew.

927
02:02:34,718 --> 02:02:36,551
We'll wait here. Ambush him.

928
02:02:36,687 --> 02:02:37,788
Let's go back.

929
02:02:37,923 --> 02:02:39,350
No, no, no.
We have to split up.

930
02:02:40,152 --> 02:02:42,087
Here, no time for long goodbyes.

931
02:02:42,223 --> 02:02:43,587
We've done some
mighty things together.

932
02:02:43,723 --> 02:02:44,663
Goodbye.

933
02:04:22,956 --> 02:04:24,092
I'm not Dementus!

934
02:04:27,730 --> 02:04:29,504
We swapped bikes!

935
02:07:07,328 --> 02:07:08,553
You've found me.

936
02:07:11,365 --> 02:07:12,623
Freakish.

937
02:07:13,433 --> 02:07:15,197
You are a freak.

938
02:07:18,140 --> 02:07:21,036
You could have necked me
in the night, but you didn't.

939
02:07:21,171 --> 02:07:23,711
So, you must be
that other thing.

940
02:07:24,809 --> 02:07:26,637
Are you that thing?

941
02:09:05,779 --> 02:09:07,309
I have nothing.

942
02:09:08,813 --> 02:09:10,140
I am nothing.

943
02:09:11,980 --> 02:09:12,952
I'm yours.

944
02:09:34,576 --> 02:09:35,700
Remember me?

945
02:09:49,448 --> 02:09:52,024
You fabulous thing.

946
02:09:55,161 --> 02:09:57,826
You crawled
out of a pitiless grave,

947
02:09:57,961 --> 02:09:59,328
deeper than Hell.

948
02:10:00,596 --> 02:10:02,567
And only one thing's
gonna do that for you.

949
02:10:02,703 --> 02:10:04,465
And not hope. Hate.

950
02:10:06,805 --> 02:10:08,534
No shame in hate.

951
02:10:08,670 --> 02:10:10,768
It's one of the great forces
of nature.

952
02:10:15,181 --> 02:10:16,884
That wasn't hope,
that was instinct.

953
02:10:32,125 --> 02:10:32,966
So...

954
02:10:34,670 --> 02:10:36,466
...this is the day I die.

955
02:10:37,202 --> 02:10:38,664
I've always wondered how--

956
02:10:42,802 --> 02:10:45,073
Fifteen years ago
there was a woman.

957
02:10:45,208 --> 02:10:47,007
Oh, so there's more to this.

958
02:10:47,143 --> 02:10:48,476
Do you remember her?

959
02:10:49,308 --> 02:10:50,643
Do I get a clue?

960
02:10:56,151 --> 02:10:58,525
Right, okay. Um...

961
02:10:58,660 --> 02:11:00,589
Redhead. Even her pu--

962
02:11:03,864 --> 02:11:06,864
Was she your mother? Sister?

963
02:11:06,999 --> 02:11:09,027
Did she beg, did she scream?

964
02:11:09,163 --> 02:11:11,796
The ones who yell the least tend
to stick in my mind.

965
02:11:14,107 --> 02:11:15,299
Despite everything
you did to her,

966
02:11:15,435 --> 02:11:16,905
she was magnificent.

967
02:11:17,041 --> 02:11:17,912
Oh, you were there.

968
02:11:20,847 --> 02:11:23,445
My childhood. My mother.

969
02:11:24,619 --> 02:11:25,777
I want them back.

970
02:11:26,687 --> 02:11:27,586
Of course you do.

971
02:11:27,721 --> 02:11:29,149
I want them back!

972
02:11:29,285 --> 02:11:30,621
That's exactly how I felt.

973
02:11:31,357 --> 02:11:34,056
My own family.
My own magnificent beauties.

974
02:11:34,192 --> 02:11:36,755
Taken so unjustly. Immutably.

975
02:11:36,890 --> 02:11:38,823
I'm right there,
I'm right there with you.

976
02:11:41,300 --> 02:11:43,834
I too craved nothing
but revenge.

977
02:11:43,970 --> 02:11:45,669
A big bellyful of revenge.

978
02:11:47,467 --> 02:11:49,438
If I may...

979
02:11:51,046 --> 02:11:52,513
If the shooter goes
around the back,

980
02:11:52,648 --> 02:11:53,605
the shootee won't know

981
02:11:53,741 --> 02:11:56,082
the precise moment
of the execution.

982
02:11:57,977 --> 02:12:00,345
Minor torture,
but every little bit counts.

983
02:12:00,481 --> 02:12:01,615
Either way, that rat shot

984
02:12:01,751 --> 02:12:03,815
will turn my brain
into a pink mist so fast,

985
02:12:03,950 --> 02:12:05,685
I won't even hear
the sound of the gun.

986
02:12:06,628 --> 02:12:08,089
I'll hear it.

987
02:12:08,592 --> 02:12:09,828
I'll hear it for the rest
of my days.

988
02:12:09,964 --> 02:12:10,996
Of course you will.

989
02:12:11,132 --> 02:12:12,762
I'll feel the kickback
in my hand.

990
02:12:12,897 --> 02:12:13,792
Sure.

991
02:12:15,594 --> 02:12:17,802
I'll remember your face.

992
02:12:17,938 --> 02:12:19,939
As the slug worms its way

993
02:12:20,075 --> 02:12:21,668
into the soft matter
of your brain,

994
02:12:21,803 --> 02:12:23,802
taking with it what you call
your reason.

995
02:12:24,744 --> 02:12:25,980
And your memory,

996
02:12:27,315 --> 02:12:29,680
from which my mother
will fortunately be absent.

997
02:12:29,815 --> 02:12:30,781
Brilliant.

998
02:12:31,384 --> 02:12:33,416
I'll be dead and you'll
still be sorrowing

999
02:12:33,551 --> 02:12:36,023
your lovey-dovey and
your mommy magnificent.

1000
02:12:36,591 --> 02:12:37,917
You idiot.

1001
02:12:38,052 --> 02:12:40,258
You can never balance
the scales of their suffering.

1002
02:12:43,789 --> 02:12:46,858
- Give them back.
- I can't!

1003
02:12:48,170 --> 02:12:50,460
What you want, dear,
are my cries of anguish.

1004
02:12:50,596 --> 02:12:52,203
Anguish without end.

1005
02:12:52,339 --> 02:12:54,503
And if I could give you that,
I would.

1006
02:12:54,638 --> 02:12:56,807
But I don't fear
the loss of bliss in Heaven.

1007
02:12:56,943 --> 02:12:59,211
Or retribution in Hell.

1008
02:12:59,346 --> 02:13:01,212
And I've got a fiendishly high
pain threshold.

1009
02:13:01,348 --> 02:13:03,274
- Again, do it again.

1010
02:13:09,288 --> 02:13:11,955
If you
can't do me quick,

1011
02:13:12,091 --> 02:13:13,359
you'll have to do me slow.

1012
02:13:15,156 --> 02:13:18,894
But you are never going to get
anything close to what you want.

1013
02:14:15,756 --> 02:14:17,355
Little D?

1014
02:14:23,723 --> 02:14:26,364
I have been waiting for you.

1015
02:14:26,499 --> 02:14:29,197
I've been waiting
for someone like you,

1016
02:14:29,332 --> 02:14:32,130
someone worthy of me.

1017
02:14:33,066 --> 02:14:36,969
No honor, no rule of law
to sort things out.

1018
02:14:37,104 --> 02:14:40,312
Just two evil bastards
out here in the Wasteland.

1019
02:14:41,778 --> 02:14:45,216
You do this, you do this right,
you become me.

1020
02:14:45,352 --> 02:14:47,884
- I am nothing like you.
- You are me.

1021
02:14:48,020 --> 02:14:49,781
Already dead.

1022
02:14:49,917 --> 02:14:51,918
To feel alive,
we seek sensation.

1023
02:14:52,053 --> 02:14:55,526
Any sensation to wash away
the cranky black sorrow.

1024
02:14:56,696 --> 02:14:59,295
And it leaves us for a moment,
but then it comes back,

1025
02:14:59,430 --> 02:15:00,733
and we have to do it all again.

1026
02:15:00,868 --> 02:15:02,292
And we need more,

1027
02:15:02,428 --> 02:15:05,005
and each time we need more
until too much is never enough.

1028
02:15:05,140 --> 02:15:08,604
We are the already dead,
Little D.

1029
02:15:12,571 --> 02:15:13,807
You and me.

1030
02:15:23,792 --> 02:15:25,115
The question is...

1031
02:15:28,197 --> 02:15:30,956
...do you have it in you
to make it epic?

1032
02:15:51,144 --> 02:15:52,418
<i>She took away his voice,</i>

1033
02:15:52,554 --> 02:15:55,849
<i>and they spent the rest
of the day in silence.</i>

1034
02:15:58,324 --> 02:15:59,754
<i>There are those who prefer</i>

1035
02:15:59,889 --> 02:16:02,053
<i>that she did
more than shoot him.</i>

1036
02:16:05,492 --> 02:16:10,204
<i>They claim that she ended him
in ways more fitting.</i>

1037
02:16:13,673 --> 02:16:15,666
<i>They tell
of righteous perversities</i>

1038
02:16:15,801 --> 02:16:18,102
<i>and witty mutilations.</i>

1039
02:16:21,673 --> 02:16:26,847
<i>But this is the truth whispered
to me by Furiosa herself.</i>

1040
02:16:28,815 --> 02:16:30,884
<i>Deep in the Citadel,</i>

1041
02:16:31,019 --> 02:16:34,228
<i>high up
in the hydroponic gardens,</i>

1042
02:16:35,397 --> 02:16:38,358
<i>there is a tree
unlike any other.</i>

1043
02:16:42,702 --> 02:16:46,900
<i>Its soil is human.
Its nutrients human.</i>

1044
02:16:48,136 --> 02:16:51,201
<i>Maggots debriding
his necrotic flesh.</i>

1045
02:16:52,811 --> 02:16:56,580
<i>It was an echo
growing out of a living being.</i>

1046
02:17:04,019 --> 02:17:06,059
<i>This is our first fruit,</i>

1047
02:17:06,194 --> 02:17:07,988
<i>but it's not for you and me.</i>

1048
02:17:09,358 --> 02:17:12,866
<i>Each of us in our own way
will vanish from this Earth.</i>

1049
02:17:13,002 --> 02:17:14,400
<i>And then perhaps...</i>

1050
02:17:15,769 --> 02:17:18,800
<i>...some uncorrupted life
will rise to adorn it.</i>
